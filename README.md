# License?
Deepseek generates the source code with user-given prompts. So I am unsure which license is applicable. Please share your opinion, or just create a PR for this.

# Patentable ideas?
The ideas are generated from my brain from the beginning, and I have not claimed any of them into some formal shape yet. I authorized the usage in non-commercial cases, and please clarify the background rights before applying it to commercial products. This reminder is the only thing I can support.
